# Reinforcement-Learning-Paper-Summaries
This repository contains summaries of some recent papers in active areas of RL such as Deep RL, Hierarchical RL, Model-based RL etc. 

It also includes a detailed presentation for the paper [A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887). 

Done as a part of CS7011 : Topics in Reinforcement Learning.
